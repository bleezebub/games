### Progress
## 21 Jan -> making the walls and the head of the snake
## 22 Jan -> introducing random apples and collision with the walls
## 23 Jan -> Added swiping and scrolling functionallity 
## 24 Jan -> change the direction of snake after listening to the swipe and scroll listening when it is only head, check collision with an apple
## 26 Jan -> increment the snake on collision with the apple
## 28 Jan -> make snake move when of length more than one, and also check the collision with itself
## TODO - > check collision with body itself. Not doing it -\(-_-)/-
## one bug left --> if the snake is moving right, swiping left will change it's direction. But I don't think it's an issue. May be someday.
